# Front End Capstone - Team PlayStation
In our front end capstone, we have developed a fully functional e-commerce web application integrated with existing product API that meets the specifications and requirements outlined by project stakeholders.

# Overview

The first widget of this project includes an image carousel, thumbnail carousel, extended view/zoom option, as well as product information, features, style select, and checkout section for the main product displayed. A light/dark mode toggle is also available for users on the navigation bar.

# Related Products

The Related Products carousel displays a list of products related to the main product determined by the API as well as a comparison modal when a user clicks on the star button. The outfit list carousel is unique to each user, displaying only the products that have been added by the user and persists upon close/refresh of the browser.

# Questions and Answers

# Ratings and Reviews

The ratings and reviews section displays relevant consumer feedback about the current product. The most impactful components will have the user's eye drawn to them with the popping blue theme color.
The reviews section can be sorted, filted, and extended by the user through various buttons and selections in a way that feels smooth and seemless. The ability add a new review with modal pop-ups is clean and simple to follow.
